HODL is a slang term in the cryptocurrency community that originated from a misspelled word "hold." It refers to the strategy of holding onto cryptocurrencies for a long period of time instead of selling them, even during high market volatility. It embodies a belief in the long-term value and potential of a cryptocurrency.

## Origin
The term comes from a 2013 post on the BitcoinTalk forum titled “I AM HODLING” by a user who drunkenly misspelled “holding.” The typo went viral and became an acronym for “Hold On for Dear Life.”

HODL has evolved to symbolize steadfast belief in the long-term success of crypto assets. It’s often used to resist panic-selling during market dips or crashes.

## Usage

##### Basic usage:
`Bitcoin is down 30% this week, but I’m going to HODL. I believe in its long-term value.`

##### In a tweet or meme:
`Markets are red, portfolios are bleeding, but real degens HODL!`

##### Investor strategy:
`She bought Ethereum in 2016 and decided to HODL. Now, it's one of her best-performing investments.`

##### In contrast to trading:
`While traders try to time the market, I just HODL and accumulate more when prices dip.`

##### As a rallying cry:
`The crypto crash is temporary. Remember: HODL strong!`
