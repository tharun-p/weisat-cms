Moon Missions \u0026amp; Meme Coin Madness":"Crypto ain’t just internet money—it’s the rocket fuel for a world fed up with banks and bureaucrats. Bitcoin and its 20,000+ altcoin cousins are here to rescue us from centralized control. Why do we need this wild, volatile, meme-fueled beast? Crypto’s the key to financial freedom, letting average Jane and Joe bypass middlemen, build wealth, and call their own shots. It’s a hedge against inflation that’s eating your savings, a shield from government overreach, and a decentralized dream where no one owns your money but you.

Every transaction’s etched in a tamper-proof ledger, secured by math, not promises. Compare that to banks getting hacked—Equifax leaked 147 million folks’ data like it was nothing. Crypto wallets with private keys? Untouchable unless you’re dumb enough to leak ‘em. Plus, public chains like Ethereum let you audit every move, no shady backroom deals. It’s degen-grade security for a world where trust is a meme.\n4. Moon Missions \u0026 Meme Coin Madness Crypto’s a degen playground, spawning DeFi, NFTs that make Wall Street cry.

We’ll Rugpull It":"Crypto’s wild—volatility’s a rollercoaster, scams lurk. Smart people Do Your Own Research (DYOR) to dodge rugs. Rugs? They’ll come, but crypto’s too big to ban—420M users in 2025. The chaos is worth it for the gains, the freedom, and the vibes.","9-moon-or-bust#9. Moon or Bust":"Crypto’s not just needed—it’s inevitable.

It’s where you send, receive, or store cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) or other digital assets, such as NFTs. Think of it as your personal address in the blockchain world—others can send you crypto or NFTs to this address, and you can send assets from it.\nFor example, a Bitcoin address might look like this: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa. An Ethereum address might look like: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e. Each address is tied to a specific blockchain and generated using cryptography, ensuring it’s secure and unique.\nAddress is typically derived from a private-public key pair using cryptographic algorithms. You take the Public key and process it with fancy cryptographic algorithm, you will get Address.\nWhen you are transferring crypto or other crypto assets like NFT to others, single typography of their address can send your funds to some random address and it might be lost forever."},"title":"Address"},"/glossary/hodl/":{"data":{"":"HODL is a slang term in the cryptocurrency community that originated from a misspelled word “hold.” It refers to the strategy of holding onto cryptocurrencies for a long period of time instead of selling them, even during high market volatility. It embodies a belief in the long-term value and potential of a cryptocurrency.","origin#Origin":"The term comes from a 2013 post on the BitcoinTalk forum titled “I AM HODLING” by a user who drunkenly misspelled “holding.” The typo went viral and became an acronym for “Hold On for Dear Life.”\nHODL has evolved to symbolize steadfast belief in the long-term success of crypto assets. It’s often used to resist panic-selling during market dips or crashes.","usage#Usage":"Basic usage: Bitcoin is down 30% this week, but I’m going to HODL. I believe in its long-term value.\nIn a tweet or meme: Markets are red, portfolios are bleeding, but real degens HODL!\nInvestor strategy: She bought Ethereum in 2016 and decided to HODL. Now, it's one of her best-performing investments.\nIn contrast to trading: While traders try to time the market, I just HODL and accumulate more when prices dip.\nAs a rallying cry: The crypto crash is temporary.

"},"title":"Keys"},"/glossary/nft/":{"data":{"":"An NFT, or Non-Fungible Token, is a special kind of digital item you can own, like a collectible card, a piece of art, or a song, stored on a blockchain (a secure digital record). The word “non-fungible” means it’s one-of-a-kind—there’s only one original version, and you can’t swap it for another NFT like you can with money or candy bars.\nThink of an NFT like a rare Pokémon card. Even if someone takes a picture of your card, only you own the real one, and the blockchain proves it’s yours.\nℹ️ Super Simple Analogy - Imagine buying a signed poster from your favorite singer. The signature makes it unique, and a digital “certificate” (the blockchain) proves it’s the real deal. That’s what an NFT is! You can have NFT for completely digital created product/content(Digital art) or Real world asset (RWD, Plot of land) created as token/NFT in blockchain.\nAs NFTs are unique digital assets on a blockchain, there are some standard defined in various blockchains like standar ERC-721 in Ethereum, to have a standardized approach of how to create (mint), transfer the NFT, or interact with it, so anyone in the world can interact with them.\nNFT is usually a unique string (ID) whose information(metadata) are stored in the blockchain (most cases). If you are the owner of the asset-NFT, there is link to your wallet address and NFT(ID) is created and stored in the blockchain. When you transfer the ownership, the link with the new owner address and NFT ID is linked.\nUntil you make a transaction to transfer the ownership of the NFT to new owner, nobody can take or claim the ownership of the NFT.\nNFTs are often digital art, music, or virtual items, and you can buy or sell them on websites like NFT marketplace websites like OpenSea or Rarible."},"title":"NFT"},"/glossary/wallet/":{"data":{"":"A crypto wallet is a digital tool that allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies.

The major categories are Hot, Cold, Frozen, and Deep Cold wallets.\nEvery wallet will create cryptographic keys for you and generate address for you, which will be your identifier in the blockchain (Similar to account number in bank).","types-of-wallets#Types of Wallets":"1. Hot Wallet A Hot Wallet is connected to the internet and is designed for quick and frequent access to crypto assets. These are typically used for daily transactions.\n2.
